## Cashonize: a Bitcoin Cash Wallet

**Cashonize is an easy-to-use, multi-platform Bitcoin Cash wallet** <br>
Cashonize supports CashTokens and WalletConnect which makes it an ideal wallet for using dapps on BCH. <br>
Currently Cashonize is available as a webwallet, a desktop application (for Windows & Linux), an Android APK and an Installable web app. <br>

### The wallet for you?

Because of its minimalist design, Cashonize is a user-friendly wallet, even for inexperienced users.
Cashonize has an easy-to-understand transaction preview screen for WalletConnect and CashConnect, empowering users before signing DeFi transactions.
Further, Cashonize nicely groups and displays your NFTs, making it ideal for NFT collectors.

Cashonize has multi-wallet support with both single-address and HD wallet options. HD wallets use a new address for each transaction, providing basic privacy for everyday payments.

Cashonize does not currently support password or pin locked wallets and encrypted seed phrases.
