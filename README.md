## Cashonize: a Bitcoin Cash Wallet

**Cashonize is an easy-to-use, multi-platfrom Bitcoin Cash wallet** <br>
Cashonize supports CashTokens and WalletConnect which makes it an ideal wallet for using dapps on BCH. <br>
Currently Cashonize is available as webwallet and a desktop application. <br>


### The wallet for you?

Because of its minimalist design, Cashonize is a user-friendly wallet, even for inexperienced users .
Cashonize nicely displays your NFT collections by collapsing NFTs of the same tokenId, making it ideal for NFT collectors.

Cashonize is a single-address wallet, for privacy-centered users is better to use a HD-wallet.

## Platforms

🖥️ Desktop version: https://github.com/cashonize/cashonize-quasar/releases

🌐 Webwallet: [cashonize.com](cashonize.com) 

**Note:** webwallets are great for convenience, but desktop applications are more secure. <br>
⚠️ [cashonize.com](cashonize.com) is the only correct URL for the webwallet
