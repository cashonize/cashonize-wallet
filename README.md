## Cashonize: a Bitcoin Cash Wallet

**Cashonize is an easy-to-use, multi-platform Bitcoin Cash wallet** <br>
Cashonize supports CashTokens and WalletConnect which makes it an ideal wallet for using dapps on BCH. <br>
Currently Cashonize is available as a webwallet, a desktop application (for Windows & Linux) and an Android APK. <br>

### The wallet for you?

Because of its minimalist design, Cashonize is a user-friendly wallet, even for inexperienced users.
Cashonize has an easy-to-understand transaction preview screen for WalletConnect and CashConnect, empowering users before signing DeFi transactions.
Further, Cashonize nicely groups and displays your NFTs, making it ideal for NFT collectors.

Cashonize is a single-address wallet, for privacy-focused users is recommended to use a HD-wallet for payments instead.
However WalletConnect on BCH is currently always single-address based.
